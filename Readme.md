# Mini Game Jam

This is one of the project made in the event which main theme was: "Healthy & Equal Relationship".

This game was made using Game Maker Studio 2, using the integrated GML of the engine.

## Instalation

You just have to download the project as a ZIP file, or clone the repository. Finally, open the main project file with Game Maker Studio 2. I have not an executable, because it was made in the Trial demo version of the engine.

## About the Game

This game is (or intended to be) a funny clich√© about being in a love relationship. In this game you control a man/woman/apache helicopter/*[insert **any** gender here]* who wears a blue t-shirt and tries to have a good relationship with a man/woman/*[insert **any** gender here]* who wears a pink t-shirt.

The pink character walks randomly along the scene. You have to be careful and preserve your relationship healthy!
* If you get too closer to your partner, he/she/it will feel mad at you because you don't give his/her/its personal space and will feel like you are so dense. **The relationship, loses health.**
* If you go too far, your partner will be sad and feeling lonely because you do your stuff forgetting your partner. **The relationship, loses health.**
* If you pick up a vegetable, your partner will lose his/her/its mind and will pursue you because he/she/it **REALLY** hates vegetables. **The relationship, loses health and you have to run for your life!**

BUT!
* If you pick up money, your partner will be happier because we all know that money is the only thing that really matters. **The relationship, gains health!**
* If you pick up hearts, your partner will know that you love, appreciate and take care of this relationship. **The relationship, gains health!**
* If you collect all your relationship life goals, **you and your partner win!**. In this case the 4 goals are buy a car, buy a house, go to vacations and get married. *Easy peasy lemon squeezy...*

### Controls

You can control the blue character using the arrow buttons.  
If you want to start everything from the start again, you can press the **R** key. Why life doesn't have this feature??

### Mission

* You have to preserve your relationship healthy, collecting coins and heart shaped items.
* You complete the game collecting the 4 goals.
* Everything will appear randomly along the scene.
* Keep your and your partner spaces in touch all the time!
* Don't get too close to your partner.
* Avoid vegetables!

## Warnings

* This is **NOT** based in a true story... well... I hope not.
* Don't play this with your girlfriend at your side. You would sleep on the floor tonight.
* The makers don't take any responsabilities for any damage that could happen playing this game with your girlfriend.
* Money it's **NOT the only thing that really matters!** It was a joke, for God sake! Life is not only about money, hearts, a car, a house, and vacations... it's just that we didn't have so much time to improve the game and its message. 
* Vegetables sucks... and **THAT is for real**!

## Recomendations
* Don't let your girlfriend/boyfriend get mad at you.
